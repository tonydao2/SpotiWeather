## Assignments:

### Assignment 1:

**Idea 1:** Our idea is to create a web app that uses a Weather API and Spotify API to read the weather and give a playlist appropriate to it.

**Idea 2:** Another idea we have is to have an app that gives the user a reccomendation of recipes by having them choose their current mood.

**Idea 3:** Another idea we had is to create an app that uses the Netflix API to find movies and the Spotify API to match playlists to the soundtrack of that movie.

### Assignment 2:

#### User Story 1:
As a user I want to be able to add the playlist to my library 
Upon arriving at the website, the user logs in with spotify, and inputs their current location. The website will then show the playlist of music that correlates to the weather (temperature and precipitation) of the userâ€™s current location and shows them what songs are on it, then the user can add the playlist that the application created to their spotify library.

#### User Story 2:
As a user I want to find be able to discover new music 
Upon arriving at the website, the user will log in with their spotify. Next, the user must input their current location. The web-app would generate a playlist for the user and shows them the weather and which songs are on the playlist. If they do not like the playlist they can refresh and get a new one. They then can add this playlist to their spotify library. Once it is in their library, they can see songs that they do not have liked/downloaded are in the playlist. 

#### User Story 3:
As a user I want to listen to music I know that I will enjoy 
Upon arriving at the website, the user logs in to their spotify and provides their current location. The app will generate a playlist based on the weather and add some songs from their liked songs. The user will be able to see the weather of the day and what songs are in the playlist that was generated for them. This way, the user will be able to enjoy a playlist with songs that they already know and like, along with new music.

#### User Story 4:
As a user I want to be able to regenerate a new playlist if I do not like the one that the application generates
On the web app, the user logs into their spotify and input their current location. The web app would then generate a playlist for the user and show them the weather for that day. If they do not like this playlist, there will be the option to refresh and the application will generate a new playlist corresponding to the weather for that day.

#### User Story 5:
As a user I want a playlist with a variety of songs (not too short and no repeats of songs)
Upon arrival to the web app, the user will log into their spotify and input their current location. The web app will generate a playlist based on the weather of the day and display the playlist as well as the weather. The user can then refresh the playlist to generate a new one or add this to their library. Once added to their library, they will see at least 10-15 different songs In the playlist.

#### User Story 6:
As a user I want to be able to have the option to add this playlist automatically to my library daily
On the web app, The user will log into their spotify and input their current location. Upon inputting their current location, the web app will create a playlist based on the weather of the day. The user will be able to see the songs as well as the weather of the day. There will be an option that asks the user if they would like the generated playlists to be added automatically to their library. If the user clicks yes, the playlists 

#### User Story 7:
As a user I want two distinct playlists for two days with the same weather
Upon arrival to the website main page, the User will see a text box where they will enter their current location and a generate playlist button. Here the user can enter their location, then push the button to generate a playlist based on the weather and precipitation of their location. Our web app will read the weather and see if the user created a playlist the previous day and if so, it will check to see if the weather was the same the previous day, so as to not create a copy of the same playlist. It will add songs to the playlist that was not there the previous day.
